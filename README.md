Introduction. Thee-state-of-the-art. Google search using keywords "scoliosis and accelerometer" propose Cobb angle measurement method for postero-anterior radiographs using a smartphone that incorporates a   micro-electro-mechanical-system  (MEMS) accelerometer [1].The accelerometer accurately senses the static acceleration of gravity for tilt-sensing applications. The aim of research article  [1] was to quantify the measurement performance of the smartphone compared with a standard protractor for the assessment of coronal Cobb angles on hardcopy radiographs.  The mean  absolute  difference  between pairs  of smartphone/protractor   measurements was   2.1 deg,   with a small (1 deg) bias toward lower Cobb angles with the smartphone. A smart garment with integrated accelerometers and gyroscopes, which can detect postural changes regarding sagittal and coronal planes of curvature variation of the spine, has been developed with an intention to facilitate posture training in [2]. The smart garment was tested in laboratory tests and with five healthy subjects during their daily activities and confirmed that the accuracy of the system is < 1°  in static and < 1.5° in dynamic tilting measurements. The results preented in [2] show that the intelligent werable device facilitates subjects to prevent prolonged anormal postures of the spine, particularly the posture of the lumbar spine in which at least 40% of the time in anormal posture were reduced.


Materials and methods:


In our work we are interested in prototype of t-shirt instrumented by several MEMS sensor for spinal curbature detection ( proposed t-shirt can be used in the context of eldery care as  fall detector, postural transition, walking analysis or dayly activities logger).

We use the Arduino-compatible  Wearable electronic platform FLORA [3] and 2 acelerometers.

Appendix A.
Important question to solve before starting second part of progect:
1. what is the autonomy of proposed device?
2. Were to put the BLE on the human upper body?
3. How much accelerometers nedeed to define skoleosis/kyphosys/fall/ et ect.?
4. Efficiency of cardiosensor.
