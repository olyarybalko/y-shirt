Introduction. Thee-state-of-the-art. Google search using keywords "scoliosis and accelerometer" propose Cobb angle measurement method for postero-anterior radiographs using a smartphone that incorporates a micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS) accelerometer [1].  The aim of research article [1] was to quantify the measurement performance of the smartphone compared with a standard protractor for the assessment of coronal Cobb angles on hardcopy radiographs. The mean absolute difference between pairs of smartphone/protractor measurements was 2.1 deg, with a small (1 deg) bias toward lower Cobb angles with the smartphone. A smart garment with integrated accelerometers and gyroscopes, which can detect postural changes regarding sagittal and coronal planes of curvature variation of the spine, has been developed with an intention to facilitate posture training in [2]. The smart garment was tested in laboratory tests and with five healthy subjects during their daily activities and confirmed that the accuracy of the system is < 1° in static and < 1.5° in dynamic tilting measurements. The results presented in [2] show that the intelligent wearable device facilitates subjects to prevent prolonged abnormal postures of the spine, particularly the posture of the lumbar spine in which at least 40% of the time in a normal posture were reduced.

This fast exploration means that accelerometer, that senses the static acceleration of gravity for tilt-sensing applications is sufficient and is accepted for the medical application.



Materials and methods:


In our work we are interested in prototype of t-shirt instrumented by several MEMS sensor for spinal curbature detection ( proposed t-shirt can be used in the context of eldery care as  fall detector, postural transition, walking analysis or dayly activities logger).

We use the Arduino-compatible  Wearable electronic platform FLORA [3] and 2 acelerometers.

Appendix A.

An important question to solve before starting the second part of the project:
1. What is the autonomy of proposed device?
2. Where to put the BLE on the human upper body?
3. How many accelerometers needed to define skoleosis/kyphosys/fall/ et ect.?
4. The efficiency of cardio-sensor.
5. How many measures do we need to be energy optimal and still efficient?
6. How to wash instrumented t-shirt?
7. Stress - fatigue measures.

Appendix B.

We need to use the componets for increase the price and to miniaturize the setup:
